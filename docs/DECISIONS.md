# Decisions

Short architecture decision records. Newest at the bottom.

## ADR-001 Android TV, native Kotlin + Compose

Context: Target is a set-top box driven by an IR/Bluetooth remote; playback must be hardware-decoded
and start fast. Decision: native Android TV app in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose (no Leanback
fragments, no web wrapper). Consequences: full control of key handling and ExoPlayer; Kotlin rather
than Java is the cost for a Java-first team, offset by Compose and coroutine ergonomics.

## ADR-002 Media3 ExoPlayer for IPTV streams

Context: HLS, DASH and MPEG-TS from IPTV providers, some needing custom headers. Decision: Media3
ExoPlayer with `DefaultMediaSourceFactory` and a `DefaultHttpDataSource` whose headers are set per
channel. Consequences: no VLC dependency; codec coverage depends on the box's hardware decoders.

## ADR-003 YouTube via the official embedded player only

Context: The YouTube Android Player API is discontinued; stream extraction violates the terms.
Decision: play YouTube channels in a WebView using the IFrame player with `autoplay=1&controls=0`.
Fallback to evaluate: launching the YouTube TV app by intent. Consequences: some channels refuse
embedding; playback is heavier than native; app remains publishable.

## ADR-004 Configuration through a LAN web page served by the app

Context: Elderly viewers cannot configure anything; caregivers should not type on a D-pad.
Decision: embedded Ktor (CIO) server on port 8080 serving a single vanilla-JS page and a JSON API.
Consequences: zero hosting, works offline on the home network, needs a PIN before wider distribution.

## ADR-005 Missing channel numbers land on the nearest real channel

Context: Old TVs showed static on unused numbers, which confuses and frightens. Decision:
`ChannelNavigator.resolve` picks the exact match, else the next higher number, else wraps to the
lowest. Consequences: the viewer always ends up watching something; the banner shows what was chosen.

## ADR-006 Whole-list JSON file instead of a database

Context: Tens of channels, edited by one caregiver, replaced wholesale from the web UI.
Decision: one JSON file rewritten on each change, exposed as a StateFlow. Consequences: trivial
import/export and API contract; revisit only if per-channel history or EPG storage is added.

## ADR-007 Google account access for YouTube

Context: Viewers may hold YouTube Premium (no ads) or follow channels that block anonymous or
embedded playback, and caregivers asked whether the TV's signed-in Google account can be used.

Facts that constrain the options:
- The embedded IFrame player runs in the app's own WebView with its own cookie jar. It cannot see
  the Android account on the box, and an OAuth token cannot be handed to it.
- Google refuses sign-in pages inside Android WebViews ("this browser or app may not be secure").
  Working around that means spoofing the user agent, which breaks Google's policies; not an option.
- The YouTube app on the box IS signed in with the device account, and it accepts `ACTION_VIEW`
  intents for watch and channel-live URLs.
- The device account can grant an OAuth token for the **YouTube Data API** (subscriptions, live
  broadcasts of a channel). That helps the caregiver pick channels; it does not change playback.

Decision: add a per-install setting `youtubePlayback` with two modes. `EMBEDDED` (default) keeps the
TV illusion and plays anonymously. `YOUTUBE_APP` hands the channel to the YouTube app, which uses the
signed-in account. The Data API integration is a separate backlog item because it needs a Google
Cloud project and OAuth client owned by the operator.

Consequences: with `YOUTUBE_APP` the remote drives YouTube while it is in front and the viewer must
press BACK to return; that trade-off is stated in the config UI. No credentials are stored by the
app in either mode.
